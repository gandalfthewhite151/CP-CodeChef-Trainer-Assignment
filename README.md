**Suppose you need to discuss these problems in a class.**
https://www.codechef.com/problems/CATSDOGS
https://www.codechef.com/INOIPRAC/problems/INOI1301 

You have a slot of **45 minutes** each for the problems. 

**Tell us how would you go about it?**

Write down a script detailing how you would explain the problem, what kind of leading questions you would ask, to get the students to think about it on their own, what kind of clues you'd give to nudge them towards the solution, etc. 

At the end of the session, every student should not only know how to solve the problem, but also understand what the thought process was, in getting to the solution, and also should be fully convinced of the solution. 

You can format it like a conversation you have with the students. But you can also choose any format you prefer.

You should also discuss the various edge cases, and some implementation details. But the focus is not on this, but more on the explanation.

**Note: Each script should be detailed, and have no less than 500 words.**

**For problem 1, CATSDOGS**, assume that your target audience knows only programming basics. They are new to algorithms and competitive programming altogether. You should also present a rigorous proof.

**In problem 2, INOI1301**, you can assume that you have taught students the basics of dynamic programming previously.
